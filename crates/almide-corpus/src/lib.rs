//! Where the judge lives (ARCHITECTURE.md §4, "the judge is external").
//!
//! The language's normative text, contract ledger and conformance corpus are
//! the separate repository almide/als, mounted as the git submodule `als/` and
//! pinned by commit. Implementation-resident fixtures (`spec/churn`,
//! `spec/pass_isolated` — tied to this compiler's internals) stay in this
//! tree. Every gate addresses a fixture by its CORPUS-RELATIVE path
//! (`spec/lang/x.almd`): that is the name the oracle saw, the name embedded
//! in emitted diagnostics and ASTs, and the name the ledger cites — so the
//! mount is a pure location indirection, never a rename.
