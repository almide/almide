<!-- description: Reduce clone overhead for heap types without exposing ownership -->

# Codegen Optimization [IN PROGRESS]

Almide generates Rust code that is near-identical in performance to hand-written Rust for numeric workloads (n-body: 1.74s vs Rust 1.69s). However, heap-allocated types (String, List, Map) incur unnecessary clone overhead. The goal is to close this gap **without exposing ownership to the user**.

### Phase 0: Correctness fixes ✅

`vec![f1, f2]` moved variables, causing use-after-move. Fixed by emitting `.clone()` for Ident expressions inside list literals.

### Phase 1: Eliminate unnecessary clones ✅

No language changes — the emitter generates smarter Rust code.

#### 1a. Single-use move analysis ✅

Variables used exactly once in a function body skip `.clone()` (safe to move). Conservative: for-loops and lambdas count as multi-use. Parameters always cloned.

#### 1b. String/List concatenation optimization ✅

`var = var ++ expr` → `push_str` / `.extend()` via `AlmidePushConcat` trait dispatch.

### Phase 2: In-place mutation syntax ✅

#### 2a. List element update ✅ — `xs[i] = v`
#### 2b. Record field update ✅ — `r.f = v`

---

### Phase 3: Borrow Inference (Lobster-style auto escape analysis) ✅

**Design doc: [borrow-inference-design.md](./borrow-inference-design.md)**

The compiler infers when a function parameter is read-only and emits `&str` / `&[T]` / `&HashMap<K,V>` instead of owned types. Callers pass `&x` instead of `x.clone()`. Zero user-facing changes.

#### 3a. Intra-function escape analysis ✅

For each user-defined function, analyze whether each heap-type parameter escapes:

| Escape condition | Example | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Returned | `fn id(s: String) -> String = s` | owned |
| Stored in collection | `[s, "other"]` | owned |
| Stored in record | `{ name: s }` | owned |
| Passed to owned param of another user fn | `other_fn(s)` (if `other_fn.s` is owned) | owned |
| Captured by lambda | `fn(x) => s ++ x` | owned |
| Assigned to var | `var x = s` | owned |
| **None of the above** | `string.len(s)`, `println(s)` | **borrow** |

- [x] `EscapeAnalysis` pass: walk each fn body, classify params as `Borrow` or `Owned`
- [x] Emit `&str` / `&[T]` / `&HashMap<String, T>` for borrow params
- [x] Emit `&x` at call sites for borrow params; `x.clone()` or move for owned
- [x] Stdlib calls: recognized as non-escaping (both `Expr::Ident` builtins and `Expr::Member` module calls)
- [x] `borrowed_params` tracking in emitter for correct body codegen (`borrow_to_owned`, skip `.as_str()` on `&str`)

#### 3b. Inter-function fixpoint analysis ✅

A calls B with param `x`. Whether `x` escapes in A depends on B's classification of that param. Fixpoint iteration with monotone lattice (Borrow → Owned only):

- [x] Fixpoint loop: up to 10 rounds, re-analyze all fns with callee borrow info
- [x] `check_escape_expr_inner` checks callee param ownership — borrow params don't cause caller escape
- [x] Module-qualified name lookup for intra-module calls (`current_module` tracking)
- [x] `main` excluded from analysis (runtime wrapper passes owned args)
- [x] `borrowed_params` cleared per function/test to prevent leakage

#### 3c. List/Map type borrow ✅

- [x] `is_heap_type` expanded: `List[T]` → `&[T]`, `Map[K,V]` → `&HashMap<K,V>`
- [x] TOML stdlib templates: `.clone()` → `.to_vec()` (works for both `Vec<T>` and `&[T]`)
- [x] Updated `list.toml` (28 occurrences), `map.toml` (2), `random.toml` (1)

### Priority / Status

| Phase | Status | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| 0. Correctness | ✅ Done | Prerequisite |
| 1a. Single-use move | ✅ Done | High — most common pattern |
| 1b. Concat optimization | ✅ Done | Medium — loop perf |
| 2a. List index assign | ✅ Done | High — mutable algorithms |
| 2b. Field assign | ✅ Done | Medium — record mutation |
| 3a. Intra-fn borrow | ✅ Done | High — idiomatic Rust |
| 3b. Inter-fn fixpoint | ✅ Done | High — optimal |
| 3c. List/Map borrow | ✅ Done | Medium — full coverage |

### Next: Phase 4

Remaining clone reduction opportunities identified in [clone-reduction.md](../active/clone-reduction.md):
- For-in unconditional clone
- List/tuple element clone (use-count aware)
- Member access clone (single-use awareness)
- Match subject clone (post-match liveness)
- Record spread clone (single-use move)
- Field-level borrow analysis

Additional codegen refinements in [codegen-refinement.md](../active/codegen-refinement.md):
- let mut → let refinement
- `#[inline]` hints
- Constant folding
- String literal context awareness
- Light dead code elimination
