# Closure Architecture v2

> **One identity, one capture-set, lifting is lowering.** A closure is a single
> canonical value with a program-unique identity and an explicit, once-computed
> capture set; *inlining* is a separate, escape-proven rewrite — never a
> representational shortcut. This is the closure analogue of how `Verified` /

## Why

Today a single source lambda `(x) => f(x)` is represented up to **five** different
ways depending on use-site syntax, capture analysis, mutability, and target:

1. an inline iterator-adapter callback (`IterStep`/`IterCollector`, Rust);
2. a surviving raw `IrExprKind::Lambda` value;
3. a lifted `__closure_N` function + `ClosureCreate` + `EnvLoad` triple (WASM, immutable captures);
4. a heap-cell mutable-capture raw `Lambda` (WASM);
5. an eta-expanded wrapper / `FnRef` (named functions).

Captures are **not** stored on the `Lambda` node; they are re-derived by **three**
independent free-variable analyses (`FreeVarCollector` in closure conversion,
`ClosureScanner` in `emit_wasm`, and Rust's implicit `move`), feeding **two**
near-duplicate WASM env builders (`emit_lambda_closure` vs `emit_closure_create`).
`Ty::Fn { params, ret }` is the *only* callable type — it carries no closure /
capture / calling-convention tag, so every operational distinction lives
implicitly in *which node kind* and *which pipeline branch* was chosen.

The conceptual-integrity defect: **there is no canonical "function value."** The
representation is *guessed* from the lambda's shape (`free.is_empty()` ⟹ "this
will be inlined at a HOF call site"), a property the pass cannot actually see.

### The verified bug this produces

`ClosureConversionPass` keeps non-capturing lambdas raw (`pass_closure_conversion.rs`
`free.is_empty()` branch). Raw lambdas are correlated to their pre-scanned
`LambdaInfo` at emit by `lambda_id` — but `lambda_id` **resets to 0 per module**
(`LowerCtx::new`) and module lambdas are **never registered** (the WASM pre-scan
only walks `program.functions`). Result, reproduced on 0.23.14 with an 8-line
two-module program:

```almide
// src/lib.almd
pub fn neg() -> (Int) -> Int = (n) => 0 - n
// main.almd
import self.lib
fn apply(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int = f(x)
fn add() -> (Int) -> Int = (n) => n + 1000
effect fn main() -> Unit = {
  println(int.to_string(apply(add(), 5)))     // 1005  (correct on both)
  println(int.to_string(apply(lib.neg(), 5))) // want -5; WASM printed 1005
}
```

`lib.neg()(5)` returns `1005` (main's `add` body) on WASM — a silent wrong result.
A variant with no main-program lambda emits invalid WASM
(`unknown table 0: table index out of bounds`). Native is correct because the
Rust target uses native closures and never runs the WASM id-matching path.

## The principle: separate three conflated concerns

| Concern | Today (broken) | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** — *which* closure | per-module `lambda_id`, collides across modules | program-unique `ClosureId` |
| **Capture set** — *what* it closes over | re-derived by 3 analyses, can diverge | one shared analysis, attached to the node, with explicit `mode` + precise `Ty` |
| **Representation** — *how* it is laid out & called | guessed from capture-emptiness → 5 shapes | the `Lambda` value node is canonical through the shared pipeline; *lifting* is a target lowering; *inlining* is the proven absence of lifting |

The inversion: **today the representation is guessed from the lambda's shape;
in v2 it is proven from the use** (escape analysis decides per call-site), while
identity and captures are computed once and shared by all targets.

## The boundary: shared semantic core vs target lowering

The redesign's single most important decision (a uniform *lifted* `Closure{code,env}`
node is the wrong altitude — it is a WASM lowering form; pushing it through Rust
forces a backwards reconstruction of native closures that defeats `rustc`, and
WGSL cannot represent it at all):

**SHARED (in `almide-ir`, computed once over functions *and* modules, before the
pipeline splits):**

- `ClosureId(u32)` — program-unique identity, replaces `lambda_id: Option<u32>`.
- The capture set, attached to the node:
  `Lambda { params, body, id: ClosureId, captures: Vec<Capture>, escape: EscapeVerdict }`,
  `Capture { var, ty: Ty /* Almide owned type */, mode: ByVal | ByMutCell }`.
  Non-capturing ⟹ `captures: []`. No `free.is_empty()` bypass.
- A program-wide `ClosureTable` keyed by `ClosureId` (functions + modules).
- One shared free-var + escape analysis fills all of the above.

`Lambda` (carrying id + captures + escape) **stays the canonical closure VALUE
form through the entire shared pipeline.** There is no shared lifted
`Closure{code,env}` node.

**TARGET LOWERING (each reads the shared capture-set + escape verdict):**

- **Rust** — never lifts. Emits native `move |params| body`, driving
  `CaptureClonePass` deterministically from `captures` (delete the
  `needs_clone_type` allowlist). `ParamBorrow` materialization (`to_vec`/`to_owned`)
  is a Rust-representation derivation. Escape-required stored forms → `Rc<dyn Fn>`.
  Lets `rustc` optimize.
- **WASM** — a WASM-only `ClosureLowering` pass lifts **only the closures that
  survive `InlineClosures`** (the escaping ones) to `__closure_N` + a `Ty::EnvPtr`
  env + `EnvLoad`, registered in the `ClosureTable` → func-table **by name**
  (order-independent, module-safe). One env builder; one `valtype_and_load(ty, mode)`
  helper centralizing ValType selection, mut-cell-as-i32, and narrow-int
  sign-extension. `call_indirect` type index comes from the lifted fn's registered
  `closure_type_idx` via `ClosureId` — **one source of truth**.
- **WGSL** — a *closure-free* target. `InlineClosures` runs unconditionally inside
  `@gpu` bodies; any residual escaping closure → a hard compile error. (This
  validates the thesis from the other side: WGSL is where "inline or error" is
  forced rather than optional.)

The elegant payoff: **shared = identity + capture-set + escape-verdict; lifting,
sign-extension, `to_vec`/`to_owned`, `Rc<dyn Fn>`, `call_indirect`, and
"inline-or-error" are all per-target derivations of that one shared truth.**
Neither backend is contorted.

## InlineClosures: "prove the use"

A recognizer pass that runs **before** lifting. A closure may be inlined iff a
**two-sided** proof holds:

- **(a) the use site**: the closure is *anonymous* (not the RHS of any `Bind`),
  *single-use*, and does not escape its scope; **and**
- **(b) the sink**: the callee is on a curated allowlist of *consume-only*
  combinators carrying `@fn_arg_consumed(idx)` in `stdlib/defs`, verified once
  against the runtime impl — so the closure cannot escape *through* the call (a
  `fold` whose reducer captures the fn into the accumulator would otherwise
  escape it).

When both hold, rewrite `Call(combinator, [.., literal-closure])` → an
`InlinedHOF` node (WASM: spliced body, no alloc / no `call_indirect`; Rust:
`IterChain` adapter). Egg fusion composes `InlinedHOF`s. **A bound closure is
never inlined** ⟹ "computed once" is literally true. The WASM emitter's fast path
keys on `InlinedHOF`, not on raw-`Lambda` shape.

## The hard correctness pieces (designed in, not glossed)

- **Recursion.** Self / mutual-recursive *local* closures cannot capture
  themselves into their own env (a cycle / a not-yet-allocated value). A pre-pass
  computes SCCs over `let`-bound lambda groups; self/sibling references are
  rewritten to the `ClosureId` code symbol and the lifted fn's own `__env` param
  is threaded into the recursive call (the standard "recursive closures pass their
  own env"). Postcondition: no `env` captures the closure being constructed.
- **Mutable capture is a *lifetime* bug, not a representation bug.** `ByMutCell`
  is necessary but insufficient alone (the current code silently stores `0` into
  the env when the captured local is out of `var_map`). Fix: a `CellAlloc` node at
  the variable's *binding* site; redirect **every** read/write of that var — in
  the enclosing function too, not just the lifted body — to `CellRead`/`CellWrite`;
  the cell (`Ty::Cell(T)`, a 1-slot heap record) is RC-tracked so Perceus keeps it
  alive across the closure's escape. Delete the zero-store fallback → a
  postcondition error.
- **Perceus RC through env.** Today capture-inc fires only when `ClosureCreate` is
  a `VDecl` value — so a closure created as a call-arg or tail (exactly the verified
  bug's shape) gets **no** inc → under-count. Fix: bind inc/dec to the **Closure
  node** in *every* syntactic position (decl value, call arg, tail, list element);
  inc each heap env capture where the value is materialized, dec each on the
  Closure's own drop. `Ty::EnvPtr` is heap **and** borrowed-not-owned; EnvLoad-bound
  captures are structural borrows (no inc/dec). This gives the L5 Lean proof a clean
  handle — `inc_count(cap) == dec_count(cap)` over every path because both ends bind
  to one node — **closing the "Perceus → binary" proof chain.**
- **Type identity, one source of truth.** `Ty::EnvPtr` is a *real sealed scalar
  variant* (not a `Ty::String` alias — else Perceus `RcDec`s the env block and
  corrupts the heap); `ty_to_valtype = I32` today, target-parametrized for a future
  GC backend (`(ref $env)` + `call_ref`). `call_indirect` type comes from
  `closure_type_idx` via `ClosureId`, not re-derived from `callee.ty` per site (the
  structural `register_type` dedup is a latent second collision — the no-main
  "table OOB" variant). **Keep one `Ty::Fn`** — bifurcating the callable type
  metastasizes through unification and every `Type[Fn]` container; the convention
  lives on the node, enforced by "every callable value is a Closure after
  conversion; sites always emit the closure ABI, never sniff `.ty`."

## Phasing (every boundary perf-neutral AND invariant-satisfiable)

The red-team's rule: **totality is atomic with its dependents.** "Zero raw Lambda
after conversion" is *unsatisfiable* while egg fusion (runs before conversion,
re-emits raw lambdas) and the WASM inline fast path (`is_inline_lambda` matches
raw `Lambda`) still need raw lambdas. Never split that across releases.

| Phase | Content | Property |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | program-unique closure identity (`GlobalizeClosureIdsPass`) + register module lambdas in the WASM scan | **fixes the verified bug, perf-neutral** (fast path untouched). 8-line repro as a native==wasm regression test |
| **P1** | shared core: `ClosureId` + one free-var/escape analysis over functions+modules; attach `captures`/`escape` to the node; `ClosureTable` | representation unchanged; Rust/WASM *read* the shared set; assert old analyses agree |
| **P2** | `InlineClosures` (`InlinedHOF`) + **atomic totality**: move egg onto identified closures; rewrite the 3 WASM fast-paths to key on `InlinedHOF`; total WASM `ClosureLowering` over survivors; delete the `lambda_id`/`param_id`/counter resolver + one env builder; `Ty::EnvPtr`; `EnvLoad` via `emit_load_at`; `closure_type_idx` via `ClosureId` | "zero raw Lambda" finally satisfiable; the `unreachable`s become postcondition errors |
| **P3** | `ByMutCell` (`CellAlloc`/`CellRead`/`CellWrite`) + SCC recursion + Perceus-RC-through-env | the three correctness blockers, verified at `PerceusVerify` |
| **P4** | Rust reads the shared capture set fully; retire `needs_clone_type` + the third (implicit-move) analysis | one analysis, both targets |
| **P5** | Lean: certify `inc == dec` over env | the proof chain closes |

## P3 ground truth (measured on develop, post-P2b/A)

A behavioral probe of the three red-team "blockers" against the actual language
**corrected the framing** — only one is a live bug:

- **Recursion is moot.** A self-referential *local* lambda
  (`let fact = (n) => ... fact(n-1)`) is rejected by the checker
  (`E002 undefined function 'fact'`): recursion uses top-level `fn` (a named
  `FnRef`, not a closure value). There is nothing to fix; the SCC pass is unneeded.
- **Immutable captures already work**, heap ones included. `let prefix = "hi-"; (n) => prefix + n`
  returns the right answer on **both** targets with correct RC — the "RC-through-env"
  concern is, in practice, already handled for the immutable case.
- **Mutable captures are the only real bug**, and it is serious:
  - **Rust target — silent wrong result.** `var total = 0; let add = (x) => { total = total + x }; add(5); add(10); total`
    returns **`0`** (should be `15`). The emitter renders `let add = move |x| { total = total + x }`:
    the `move` closure captures a **copy** of `total` (it's `Copy`), so the outer
    `total` never changes. (A *silent* wrong answer — the worst class for a
    write-accuracy language.) An *escaping* mutable closure (`make_counter`) fails
    to compile entirely (`rustc E0525`, FnMut-as-Fn).
  - **WASM target — escape traps.** The heap-cell mechanism is correct for a
    *non-escaping* mutable capture (returns `15`), but a mutable closure that
    **escapes** its frame (`make_counter`) **traps at runtime**.

### The fix (feature-sized, not a patch)

A mutated-and-captured variable must be **shared mutable state**, not a moved/cloned
copy — the same conclusion the WASM cell mechanism already implements, applied to
Rust and corrected for escape:

- **Rust**: a `Mutability::Var` captured-and-mutated var is lowered to
  `Rc<Cell<T>>` (`Copy`) / `Rc<RefCell<T>>` (`!Copy`): declaration `Rc::new(Cell::new(init))`,
  every read `→ .get()`, every write `→ .set(v)`, and the closure captures `Rc::clone`
  (sharing the cell). Needs a detection set (`shared_mut_vars`) threaded into the
  walker (Bind/Var/Assign) and `CaptureClonePass` (clone the `Rc`, not the value).
- **WASM**: keep the heap cell, but fix the escape — the captured cell pointer
  must be stored into the env even when the cell var isn't a direct local at the
  closure-build site (the `var_map`-miss that stores `0`).

This is the genuine content of "ByMutCell" — a new shared-cell representation
threaded through both backends, not a one-line change. SCC-recursion and the
broad RC-through-env work in the row below are *not* needed (recursion is moot,
immutable RC already works).

**Architectural intricacy (discovered while implementing).** The Rust fix is not
just walker codegen — it needs a pipeline reorder. The capture classification
(which vars are mutated-and-captured → `shared_mut`) currently lives in the
walker's annotation phase, the *last* stage. But `CaptureClonePass` (much earlier)
is what wraps a capturing lambda in `{ let __cap = v.clone(); move |..| ..__cap.. }`,
and it *skips* `Copy` captures (an `Int` needs no pre-clone for a `move`). Once an
`Int` counter becomes `Rc<Cell<i64>>` it is **no longer `Copy`**, so it now *does*
need that clone-wrap — otherwise the `move` consumes the only `Rc` and the var is
unusable after the closure. So `CaptureClonePass` must wrap `shared_mut` captures,
but it runs *before* the classification that identifies them — a circular
dependency. Resolving it cleanly means **computing the mutated-and-captured set
once, early (before `CaptureClonePass`)**, and having both `CaptureClonePass` (wrap
+ `Rc::clone` the cell, mark `__cap` as `shared_mut` too) and the walker (Bind →
`Rc::new(Cell::new())`, read → `.get()`, write → `.set()`, owned-context →
`.get()`) consume it. That single shared analysis is the right structure (it
mirrors P1's "one analysis, both consumers"); it is also why this is a focused
feature, not a tail-of-session patch — a partial threading compiles but silently
misbehaves in some context, the exact failure mode being fixed.

Groundwork landed on the `closure-v2-p3` branch (not merged): the `shared_mut_vars`
annotation + helper, and the Copy-vs-non-Copy split in the capture classifier. The
remaining walker codegen + the `CaptureClonePass` reorder complete it.

## Honest limits

- **P0 is a targeted fix, not the redesign.** It makes `lambda_id` program-unique
  and registers module lambdas; the `free.is_empty()` representational bypass and
  the parallel raw-Lambda emit path remain until P2. It does not improve
  mutable-capture lifetime (P3) or the duplicate analyses (P1/P4).
- **The escape allowlist (`@fn_arg_consumed`) is hand-curated and verified once
  against each runtime impl** — a maintenance obligation, not an inferred property.
  A wrong annotation can inline an escaping closure; treat it as a trusted base.
- **GC migration is localized but not free**: `Ty::EnvPtr` and the Closure layout
  are target-parametrized, so a `gc` backend swaps `emit_wasm` + `ty_to_valtype`
  only — but `call_ref`/typed-funcref bring their own type-identity model to design.
- **L3 determinism interaction**: `GlobalizeClosureIdsPass` runs before
  `CanonicalizePass` and mutates only `lambda_id` (not function order), so the
  `Canonical` certificate is unaffected; closure table slots are assigned in scan
  order, independent of these ids, so emitted bytes stay host-deterministic.

P3 is on branch `closure-v2-p3` (Rust: `22a7d87a` groundwork + `232a4fac` fix; WASM: the call-target fix below).
Work in a fresh worktree from `origin/develop` (or `origin/closure-v2-p3` to build on it);
never touch the main checkout (it has unrelated uncommitted changes).

### FIXED — P3 (WASM): auto-`?` closure binding called by name (was: "drops the block")

An `effect fn` returning a closure trapped on WASM when the binding used auto-`?`:

```almide
effect fn make_adder_e(n: Int) -> (Int) -> Int = (x) => x + n
effect fn main() -> Unit = {
  let add5 = make_adder_e(5)        // auto-`?` → TRAPPED on wasm
  // let add5 = make_adder_e(5)!    // explicit `!` → always WORKED (15)
  println(int.to_string(add5(10)))
}
```

**True root cause (frontend, *not* Perceus or the `Try` emit — the earlier hypothesis
in this doc was wrong).** `lower_call_target` (`almide-frontend/src/lower/calls.rs`)
decided `Named` vs `Computed` for `add5(10)` by reading the **`var_table` snapshot
type** of `add5` and checking `matches!(.., Ty::Fn)`. In an effect fn the effect-`?`
unwrap rewrite (`auto_try`) runs *after* lowering, so at the call site `add5`'s stored
type still lags at `Result[(Int)->Int, String]` — not `Ty::Fn`. The check failed and
the call fell through to `Named { add5 }`, a function that does not exist.

That single mis-resolution produced *both* symptoms previously misattributed:
- **WASM emit `unreachable`**: the `Named { add5 }` call has no target → unresolved-call stub.
- **Perceus premature `rc_dec`**: a `Named` call is not a var reference, so `add5` looked
  unused after its bind; Perceus *correctly* freed it. Perceus was never wrong — it was
  fed a call that didn't mention the variable. (Confirmed by diffing the per-pass IR dump
  of the `?` vs `!` forms: identical through `StackBalance`; they diverge only at the
  `lower_call_target` output — `Named{add5}` vs `Computed{var2}` — present from the very
  first dump, i.e. the frontend.)

**Fix.** `lower_call_target` now decides callability from the **callee's use-site type**
(`ctx.expr_ty(callee)` — the checker has already auto-`?`-unwrapped it to the function
type), with the stored type and its `Result`-stripped form as fallbacks. A local name
that resolves to a binding is always called *through the variable* (`Computed`); the
emit then dispatches the closure and Perceus sees the use and frees after it. No change
to Perceus, the `Try` emit, or any codegen pass. The `var_table` type still lags, but the
use-site type is authoritative and sidesteps it — value-typed auto-`?` bindings already
worked for the same reason (their emit reads `Bind.ty`, which `auto_try` fixes).

Verified: `?` and `!` repros → `15` on wasm + native; the fixed `main` IR matches the
`!` form (tail-lifted `__perceus_ret`, `rc_dec` after the use); edge cases (two closures,
multiple calls in one expr, closure passed to a HOF) cross-target identical; spec 240/240;
full `cargo test`; 2 new regressions in `tests/wasm_runtime_test.rs`
(`wasm_effect_fn_returns_closure_auto_try_binding`, `_used_twice`).

### DONE — P4: one free-var analysis for both targets

The capture set is now computed by exactly one function, `almide_ir::free_vars::free_vars`,
for every consumer. Before P4 the Rust target had **two** private re-implementations that
diverged subtly from it:
- `pass_capture_clone::collect_free_vars` (fed the `__cap` clone-wrap), and
- the walker's `CaptureCollector` (a lambda-depth/locals-stack walk; fed the `RcCow`
  storage classification).

Both are deleted; both call sites now use `free_vars`. The shared analysis is strictly
more accurate — it tracks *all* binders (block `let`s including destructure, match-arm
patterns, for-in vars, nested lambdas) and is safe-by-default for new IR nodes via
`walk_expr`, where the hand-rolled scans silently dropped some — and it returns a
VarId-sorted set, so the `__cap` bindings are now emitted deterministically. Net −218 LOC.

What stays target-specific is the *projection* of that one set, which is correct, not
duplication: Rust filters to clone-worthy captures (`needs_clone_type` skips `Copy`,
`SHARED_MUT` forces the `Rc<Cell>` ones) and classifies `RcCow`; WASM stores every
capture in the env. "Retire `needs_clone_type`" is realized as retiring the duplicate
*scans* that fed it — the predicate itself is a one-line Rust clone policy, not an
analysis. Verified: spec 240/240, full `cargo test`, and native==wasm on the tricky
cases (mutable `Copy` capture → shared cell, a var captured by two closures, a nested
closure capturing an outer-of-outer var).

### DONE — P5: the env RC contract, certified in Lean

`AlmidePerceusBelt/ClosureRc.lean` (kernel-verified by `lake build`, no `sorry`/`axiom`).
The compiler lowers a closure's lifecycle to ordinary `RcInc`/`RcDec` IR nodes
(`PerceusPass` + Rule 6 in `pass_perceus.rs`): create inc's each captured heap var and
allocs the closure object; drop dec's the object then each capture. `closureScope` models
exactly that lowering using only the existing `inc`/`dec`/`vdecl` `FnBody` nodes — nothing
axiomatic — and the contract is *derived*, not assumed:

- `closure_env_rc_balanced` — over its captures a closure inc's and dec's each variable the
  same number of times (`inc == dec`); its net contribution to every capture's refcount is 0.
- `closure_preserves_isFreed` — a closure leaves the free-balance of every borrowed capture
  intact (no leak, no double free of a captured value).
- `closure_obj_freed` — the closure object itself is freed (the `dec cv` at drop).
- `closureScope_allHeapFreed` — closures satisfy `allHeapFreed` whenever their continuation
  does, folding them into the same end-to-end no-leak theorem (`perceus_all_heap_freed`) as
  ordinary heap variables.

Modeling the *actual* inc/dec lowering (rather than adding an axiomatic Closure constructor)
is the stronger result: it proves the code the compiler really emits is RC-correct. This
closes the Perceus→binary proof chain for closures — the one path that was previously
outside the proof.

### DONE — P6: non-Copy mutable captures (the silent-wrong gap, closed)

Surfaced while red-teaming completeness: `var acc: List = []; let f = () => list.push(acc, 1);
f(); f(); list.len(acc)` returned **0** on BOTH targets — the closure's mutation was lost.
P3 had only covered Copy scalars (`Rc<Cell>` / heap cell); a non-Copy capture went through
Rust's `RcCow` (copy-on-write — a shared write clones, dropping the mutation) and WASM
captured the list by value. The fix makes a captured-and-mutated non-Copy var a *shared* cell
(`SharedMut<T>` = `Rc<RefCell<T>>` on Rust; the existing heap cell on WASM):

- **Detection** keys on *mutation through the closure*, not the IR `Mutability` flag — a
  `var` mutated only via a method (`list.push`) is recorded `Let` (never reassigned). Rust's
  `CaptureClonePass` and WASM's `ClosureConversionPass` both scan for assignment / `&mut`-borrow
  / in-place-mutator (`list.push` …) of a captured var.
- **Rust**: `SharedMut` mirrors `Cell`'s `.get()/.set()` so reads/assigns lower unchanged;
  only the constructor (`SharedMut::new`) and in-place mutation (`borrow_mut()`) branch by type;
  RcCow is retired for these vars. A shared read borrows an owned snapshot (`&x.get()`) so it is
  safe even in tail position where the cell is a block-local.
- **WASM**: a mutated capture must stay a *raw* lambda (the heap-cell path) instead of lifting
  to a `ClosureCreate` whose env loses the cell; `shared_mut_vars` (computed before conversion,
  while the body still names the capture) seeds `mutable_captures` so the cell threads through
  the env and `list.push`'s realloc writes the new pointer back to it.

Verified native==wasm: mutate-through-capture (`2`), nested closures (`3`), Copy still works
(`20`), read-only captures unchanged (`40`/`104`); spec 240/240; full `cargo test`; two new
cross-target regressions. The Lean P5 proof already covers these cells with no change: a shared
cell is an ordinary captured heap object (`Rc::clone` on capture, `dec` on drop), so
`closure_env_rc_balanced` proves its `inc == dec` — content mutation is RC-orthogonal.

### Status: Closure Architecture v2 complete

P0–P6 all landed on branch `closure-v2-p3` (P0/P1/P2b merged via #329/#330/#331; P3-Rust,
P3-WASM, P4, P5, P6 are the later commits on the branch). No remaining phases — closures are
correct (incl. mutable captures of every type, both targets), use one capture analysis, and are
RC-proven in Lean.

The capture-*cell* architecture is complete. A later adversarial cross-target sweep found
adjacent divergences in how closures are *typed / parsed / stored* (string mutators on WASM,
closure-in-tuple, list-index call, typed params, closure-in-map, non-Copy-element IndexAssign) —
orthogonal to capture cells. Those are tracked separately in
[Closure Codegen Cross-Target Gaps](closure-codegen-cross-target-gaps.md) (5 fixed via #334; 2 deep
ones root-caused and open).
